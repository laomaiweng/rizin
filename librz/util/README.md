# RzUtil

This library contains all common utilities and functions that are used by other
modules in the Rizin framework, like string manipulation, data structures
(lists, vectors, trees, etc.), JSON parsing/printing, and others.

## What can I expect here?
- Functions that are very common and not specific to other modules
- Functions likely needed across several other modules
- Data structures: lists, vectors, trees, graphs, skiplist
- RzBuffer
- JSON parsing, JSON printing
- PKCS7
- BitVector
